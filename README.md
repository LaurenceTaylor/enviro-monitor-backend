# Enviroplus Sensor Backend

A very simple API to expose data collected with Enviro+ and PMS5003 sensors.

## Initial Setup

Required hardware:
- Raspberry Pi
- Enviro+ environment sensor
- PMS5003 particulate matter sensor

These instructions are to be run on your Raspberry Pi provided the above hardware is configured correctly. Note: I am not a Python developer ðŸ™‚

Readings are taken every 10 minutes by default, determined by the argument for the `run` function in `src/sensor.py`.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install the enviroplus library by running `./install.sh`
4. We will use pm2 to run our app. After install Node, install it globally with `npm i -g pm2` 
5. Start the api and sensor with `pm2 start src/api.py` and `pm2 start src/sensor.py`
6. Run `pm2 startup systemd` followed by the generated command and `pm2 save`. This will start your app on every raspberry pi boot
7. We will use nginx as a reverse proxy. Install it with `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt install nginx`
8. Replace the contents of `/etc/nginx/sites-available` with the following code:
````
server {
	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server;

	root /var/www/html;

	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	server_name _;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	}
}
````
8. Start nginx with `sudo systemctl start nginx`, or if already running `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
9. Visit your Raspberry Pi's IP address at the `/readings` endpoint to view your data. Set a `limit` query string to pull a certain number of readings from the database. To find your devices IP address you could use `arp -a` or similar

## API Schema

Just one endpoint, which will return all readings:
`/readings`

Use the limit query string to pull a certain number of entries
`/readings?limit=100`

Responses follow the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) spec, for example:
````
[
  {
    "id": 154,
    "type": "readings",
    "data": {
      "attributes": {
        "date": "2020-04-16 21:25:11",
        "pressure": 639.2067642784692,
        "temperature": 21.44291390865692,
        "pm25": 6,
        "humidity": 56.04009747852809
      }
    }
  }
]

## ToDo

- Tests if necessary
- Enable filtering by daterange
